		<ptxt><space/><b>k</b> is the proportionality constant.</ptxt>

		<ptxt>The most important consequence of Avogadro's law is the following: The ideal gas constant has the same value for all gases. This means that the constant;</ptxt>

		<ptxt><space/><b>T</b> is the temperature of the gas.</ptxt>
		<ptxt></ptxt>
		<ptxt>has the same value for all gases, independent of the size or mass of the gas molecules. This statement is nontrivial, and it embodies Avogadro's ingenious insight into the nature of ideal gases.</ptxt>
		<ptxt>One mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters (dm<sup>3</sup>) at STP, and occupies 24.45 litres at SATP (Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure = 25 degrees C and 1 atm/101.3kPa). This volume is often referred to as the molar volume of an ideal gas. Real gases may deviate from this value.</ptxt>
		<ptxt>Avogadro's law, together with the <qlink ref="cgl">combined gas law</qlink>, forms the <qlink ref="ige">ideal gas law</qlink>.</ptxt>

		<ptxt><space/><b>P</b> is the pressure of the system,</ptxt>
		<ptxt><space/><b>V</b> is the volume of the gas,</ptxt>
		<ptxt><space/><b>k</b> a constant (representative of the pressure and volume of the system).</ptxt>
		<ptxt></ptxt>
		<ptxt>So long as temperature remains constant at the same value the same amount of energy given to the system persists throughout its operation and therefore, theoretically, the value of k will remain constant.</ptxt>
		<ptxt>Forcing the volume V of the fixed quantity of gas to increase, keeping the gas at the initially measured temperature, the pressure P must decrease proportionally. Conversely, reducing the volume of the gas increases the pressure.</ptxt>
		<ptxt></ptxt>
		<ptxt>Boyle's law is commonly used to predict the result of introducing a change, in volume and pressure only, to the initial state of a fixed quantity of gas. The "before" and "after" volumes and pressures of the fixed amount of gas, where the "before" and "after" temperatures are the same (heating or cooling will be required to meet this condition), are related by the equation:</ptxt>

		<ptxt>At constant pressure, the volume of a given mass of an ideal gas increases or decreases by the same factor as its temperature (in Kelvin) increases or decreases.</ptxt>

		<ptxt><space/><b>r<sub>1</sub></b> is the rate of effusion of the first gas,</ptxt>

		<ptxt>Graham's law states that the rate of diffusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular weight. Thus, if the molecular weight of one gas is four times that of another, it would diffuse through a porous plug or escape through a small pinhole in a vessel at half the rate of the other.</ptxt>
