			<ptxt>The electrolysis of water is a simple method of producing hydrogen, although the resulting hydrogen necessarily has less energy content than was required to produce it. A low voltage current is run through the water, and gaseous <elink ref="8">oxygen</elink> forms at the <glink ref="anode">anode</glink> while gaseous hydrogen forms at the <glink ref="cathode">cathode</glink>. Typically the <glink ref="cathode">cathode</glink> is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage. If, however, the gas is to be burnt on site, <elink ref="8">oxygen</elink> is desirable to assist the combustion, and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals.

			<ptxt><elink ref="1">Hydrogen</elink> can be prepared in several different ways but the economically most important processes involve removal of hydrogen from hydrocarbons. Commercial bulk hydrogen is usually produced by the steam reforming of natural gas. At high temperatures (700 - 1100&degree;C), steam (water vapour) reacts with methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) to yield <elink ref="6">carbon</elink> monoxide (CO) and H<sub>2</sub>.</ptxt>

			<ptxt>Hydrogen is sometimes produced and consumed in the same industrial process, without being separated. In the Haber process for the production of ammonia (the world's fifth most produced industrial compound), hydrogen is generated from natural gas.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Hydrogen is also produced in usable quantities as a co-product of the major petrochemical processes of steam cracking and reforming. Electrolysis of brine to yield <elink ref="17">chlorine</elink> also produces hydrogen as a co-product.</ptxt>
		</method>
		<method title="Biological syntheses">
			<ptxt>H<sub>2</sub> is a product of some types of anaerobic metabolism and is produced by several micro-organisms, usually via reactions catalyzed by <elink ref="26">iron</elink>- or <elink ref="28">nickel</elink>-containing enzymes called hydrogenases. These enzymes catalyze the reversible redox reaction between H<sub>2</sub> and its component two <elink ref="proton">protons</elink> and two <glink ref="electron">electrons</glink>. Evolution of <elink ref="1">hydrogen</elink> gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during pyruvate fermentation to water.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Water splitting, in which water is decomposed into its component <glink ref="proton">protons</glink>, <glink ref="electron">electrons</glink>, and <elink ref="8">oxygen</elink>, occurs in the light reactions in all photosynthetic organisms. Some such organisms - including the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and cyanobacteria - have evolved a second step in the dark reactions in which protons and electrons are reduced to form H<sub>2</sub> gas by specialized hydrogenases in the chloroplast. Efforts have been undertaken to genetically modify cyanobacterial hydrogenases to efficiently synthesize H<sub>2</sub> gas even in the presence of <elink ref="8">oxygen</elink>.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Other rarer but mechanistically interesting routes to H<sub>2</sub> production also exist in nature. Nitrogenase produces approximately one equivalent of H<sub>2</sub> for each equivalent of N<sub>2</sub> reduced to ammonia. Some phosphatases reduce phosphite to H<sub>2</sub>.</ptxt>

	<isolation>
		<method title="Natural Abundance">
			<ptxt>Helium is the second most abundant element in the known Universe after <elink ref="1">hydrogen</elink> and constitutes 23% of the elemental mass of the universe. It is concentrated in stars, where it is formed from <elink ref="1">hydrogen</elink> by the nuclear fusion of the proton-proton chain reaction and CNO cycle. According to the Big Bang model of the early development of the universe, the vast majority of helium was formed during Big Bang nucleosynthesis, from one to three minutes after the Big Bang. As such, measurements of its abundance contribute to cosmological models.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>In the Earth's atmosphere, the concentration of helium by volume is only 5.2 parts per million, largely because most helium in the Earth's atmosphere escapes into space due to its inertness and low mass. In the Earth's heterosphere, a part of the upper atmosphere, helium and other lighter gases are the most abundant elements.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Nearly all helium on Earth is a result of radioactive decay. The decay product is primarily found in minerals of <elink ref="92">uranium</elink> and <elink ref="90">thorium</elink>, including cleveites, pitchblende, carnotite, monazite and beryl, because they emit alpha particles, which consist of helium <glink ref="nucleus">nuclei</glink> (He<sup>2+</sup>) to which <glink ref="electron">electrons</glink> readily combine. In this way an estimated 3.4 litres of helium per year are generated per cubic kilometer of the Earth's crust. In the Earth's crust, the concentration of helium is 8 parts per billion. In seawater, the concentration is only 4 parts per trillion. There are also small amounts in mineral springs, volcanic gas, and meteoric <elink ref="26">iron</elink>. The greatest concentrations on the planet are in natural gas, from which most commercial helium is derived.</ptxt>
		</method>
		<method title="Modern Extraction">
			<ptxt>For large-scale use, helium is extracted by fractional distillation from natural gas, which contains up to 7% helium. Since helium has a lower <glink ref="bp">boiling point</glink> than any other element, low temperature and high pressure are used to liquefy nearly all the other gases (mostly <elink ref="7">nitrogen</elink> and methane). The resulting crude helium gas is purified by successive exposures to lowering temperatures, in which almost all of the remaining <elink ref="7">nitrogen</elink> and other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture. Activated charcoal is used as a final purification step, usually resulting in 99.995% pure, Grade-A, helium. The principal impurity in Grade-A helium is <elink ref="10">neon</elink>.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>As of 2004, over one hundred and fifty million cubic metres of helium were extracted from natural gas or withdrawn from helium reserves, annually, with approximately 84% of production from the <slink ref="US">United States</slink>, 10% from Algeria, and most of the remainder from <slink ref="CA">Canada</slink>, <slink ref="CN">China</slink>, <slink ref="PO">Poland</slink>, <slink ref="QA">Qatar</slink>, and <slink ref="RU">Russia</slink>. In the <slink ref="US">United States</slink>, most helium is produced in Kansas and Texas.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Diffusion of crude natural gas through special semi-permeable membranes and other barriers is another method to recover and purify helium. Helium can be synthesized by bombardment of <elink ref="3">lithium</elink> or <elink ref="5">boron</elink> with high-velocity <glink ref="proton">protons</glink>, but this is not an economically viable method of production.</ptxt>

			<ptxt>On Earth, lithium is widely distributed, but because of its reactivity does not occur in its free form. In keeping with the origin of its name, lithium forms a minor part of almost all igneous rocks and is also found in many natural brines. Lithium is the thirty-first most abundant element, contained particularly in the minerals spodumene (LiAl(SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>), lepidolite ((KLi<sub>2</sub>Al(Al,Si)<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub>(F,OH)<sub>2</sub>), petalite (LiAlSi<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>), and amblygonite ((Li,Na)AlPO<sub>4</sub>(F,OH)). On average, Earth's crust contains 65 parts per million (ppm) lithium.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Since the end of World War II, lithium metal production has greatly increased. The metal is separated from other elements in igneous mineral such as those above, and is also extracted from the water of mineral springs.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>The metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused lithium and <elink ref="19">potassium</elink> chloride. In 1998 it was about US$ 43 per pound ($95 per kg).</ptxt>
			<ptxt><slink ref="CL">Chile</slink> is currently the leading lithium metal producer in the world, with Argentina next. Both countries recover the lithium from brine pools. In the <slink ref="US">United States</slink> lithium is similarly recovered from brine pools in Nevada.</ptxt>

Precious forms of beryl are aquamarine and emerald.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>The most important commercial sources of beryllium and its compounds are beryl and bertrandite. Beryllium metal did not become readily available until 1957. Currently, most production of this metal is accomplished by reducing beryllium fluoride with <elink ref="12">magnesium</elink> metal. The price on the US market for vacuum-cast beryllium ingots was 338 US$ per pound ($745/kg) in 2001.</ptxt>

Boron does not appear in nature in elemental form but is found combined in borax, boric acid, colemanite, kernite, ulexite and borates. Boric acid is sometimes found in volcanic spring waters. Ulexite is a borate mineral that naturally has properties of fiber optics.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Economically important sources are from the ore rasorite (kernite) and tincal (borax ore) which are both found in the Mojave Desert of California, with borax being the most important source there. The largest borax deposits are found in Central and Western <slink ref="TR">Turkey</slink> including the provinces of Eskisehir, Kutahya and Balikesir.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Even a boron-containing natural antibiotic, boromycin, isolated from streptomyces, is known.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Pure elemental boron is not easy to prepare. The earliest methods used involve reduction of boric oxide with metals such as <elink ref="12">magnesium</elink> or <elink ref="13">aluminium</elink>. However the product is almost always contaminated with metal borides. (The reaction is quite spectacular though). Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halogenides with <elink ref="1">hydrogen</elink> at high temperatures. The highly pure boron, for the use in semiconductor industry, is produced by the decomposition of diborane at high temperatures and then further purified with the Czochralski process.</ptxt>

			<ptxt>In nature, free oxygen is produced by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria, green algae and plants.

		<method title="Occurrence">
			<ptxt>Fluorine in the form of fluorspar (also called fluorite) (<elink ref="20">calcium</elink> fluoride) was described in 1530 by Georgius Agricola for its use as a flux, which is a substance that is used to promote the fusion of metals or minerals. In 1670 Schwanhard found that glass was etched when it was exposed to fluorspar that was treated with acid. <blink ref="kws">Karl Wilhelm Scheele</blink> and many later researchers, including <blink ref="shd">Humphry Davy</blink>, Gay-Lussac, Antoine Lavoisier, and Louis Thenard all would experiment with hydrofluoric acid, easily obtained by treating <elink ref="20">calcium</elink> fluoride (fluorspar) with concentrated sulfuric acid.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>It was eventually realized that hydrofluoric acid contained a previously unknown element. This element was not isolated for many years after this, due to its extreme reactivity; fluorine can only be prepared from its compounds electrolytically, and then it immediately attacks any susceptible materials in the area. Finally, in 1886, elemental fluorine was isolated by Henri Moissan after almost 74 years of continuous effort by other chemists. It was an effort which cost several researchers their health or even their lives. The derivation of elemental fluorine from hydrofluoric acid is exceptionally dangerous, killing or blinding several scientists who attempted early experiments on this <glink ref="halogens">halogen</glink>. These men came to be referred to as "fluorine martyrs." For Moissan, it earned him the 1906 Nobel Prize in chemistry (Moissan himself lived to be 54, and it is not clear whether his fluorine work shortened his life).</ptxt>
			<ptxt>The first large-scale production of fluorine was needed for the atomic bomb Manhattan project in World War II where the compound <elink ref="92">uranium</elink> hexafluoride (UF<sub>6</sub>) was needed as a gaseous carrier of <elink ref="92">uranium</elink> to separate the <sup>235</sup>U and <sup>238</sup>U <glink ref="isotope">isotopes</glink> of <elink ref="92">uranium</elink>. Today both the gaseous diffusion process and the gas centrifuge process use gaseous UF<sub>6</sub> to produce enriched <elink ref="92">uranium</elink> for nuclear power applications. In the Manhattan Project, it was found that elemental fluorine was present whenever UF<sub>6</sub> was, due to the spontaneous decomposition of this compound into UF<sub>4</sub> and F<sub>2</sub>. The corrosion problem due to the F<sub>2</sub> was eventually solved by electrolytically coating all UF<sub>6</sub> carrying piping with <elink ref="28">nickel</elink> metal, which resists fluorine's attack. Joints and flexible parts were made from Teflon, then a very recently-discovered fluorine-containing plastic which was not attacked by F<sub>2</sub>.</ptxt>

Its relative rarity on Earth, like that of helium, is due to its relative lightness and chemical inertness, both properties keeping it from being trapped in the condensing gas and dust clouds of the formation of smaller and warmer solid planets like Earth. Mass abundance in the universe is about 1 part in 750 and in the Sun and presumably in the proto-solar system nebula, about 1 part in 600. The Galileo spacecraft atmospheric entry probe found that even in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter, neon is reduced by about a factor of 10, to 1 part in 6,000 by mass.

			<ptxt>Here the aluminium <glink ref="ion">ion</glink> is being reduced (<glink ref="electron">electrons</glink> are added). The aluminium metal then sinks to the bottom and is tapped off.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>At the positive electrode (<glink ref="anode">anode</glink>), <elink ref="8">oxygen</elink> is formed:</ptxt>
			<ptxt>2O<sup>2-</sup> <img type="arrow"/> O<sub>2</sub> + 4e<sup>-</sup> </ptxt>
			<ptxt>This <elink ref="6">carbon</elink> <glink ref="anode">anode</glink> is then oxidised by the <elink ref="8">oxygen</elink>, releasing carbon dioxide. The anodes in a reduction must therefore be replaced regularly, since they are consumed in the process:</ptxt>
			<ptxt>O<sub>2</sub> + C <img type="arrow"/>CO<sub>2</sub></ptxt>
			<ptxt>Unlike the anodes, the cathodes are not oxidised because there is no <elink ref="8">oxygen</elink> present at the cathode. The <elink ref="6">carbon</elink> cathode is protected by the liquid <elink ref="13">aluminium</elink> inside the cells. Nevertheless, cathodes do erode, mainly due to electrochemical processes. After five to ten years, depending on the current used in the electrolysis, a cell has to be rebuilt because of cathode wear.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Aluminium electrolysis with the Hall-Heroult process consumes a lot of energy, but alternative processes were always found to be less viable economically and/or ecologically. The world-wide average specific energy consumption is approximately 15 kilowatt-hours per kilogram of aluminium produced from alumina. (52 to 56 MJ/kg). The most modern smelters reach approximately 12.8 kWh/kg (46.1 MJ/kg). Reduction line current for older technologies are typically 100 to 200 kA. State-of-the-art smelters operate with about 350 kA. Trials have been reported with 500 kA cells.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Recovery of the metal via recycling has become an important facet of the aluminium industry. Recycling involves melting the scrap, a process that uses only five percent of the energy needed to produce aluminium from ore. Recycling was a low-profile activity until the late 1960s, when the growing use of aluminium beverage cans brought it to the public consciousness.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Electric power represents about 20% to 40% of the cost of producing aluminium, depending on the location of the smelter. Smelters tend to be situated where electric power is both plentiful and inexpensive, such as <slink ref="ZA">South Africa</slink>, the South Island of <slink ref="NZ">New Zealand</slink>, <slink ref="AU">Australia</slink>, <slink ref="CN">China</slink>, the Middle East, <slink ref="RU">Russia</slink>, Quebec and British Columbia in <slink ref="CA">Canada</slink>, and <slink ref="IS">Iceland</slink>.</ptxt>

		</method>
		<method title="Production">
			<ptxt>Industrially, iron is produced starting from iron ores, principally haematite (nominally Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) by a carbothermic reaction (reduction with carbon) in a blast furnace at temperatures of about 2000&degree;C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of coke, and a flux such as limestone (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated air is forced into the furnace at the bottom.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>In the furnace, the coke reacts with <elink ref="8">oxygen</elink> in the air blast to produce <elink ref="6">carbon</elink> monoxide:</ptxt>
			<ptxt>6C + 3O<sub>2</sub> <img type="arrow"/> 6CO</ptxt>
			<ptxt>The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the chemical equation below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming <elink ref="6">carbon</elink> dioxide in the process:</ptxt>
			<ptxt>6CO + 2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> <img type="arrow"/> 4Fe + 6CO<sub>2</sub></ptxt>
			<ptxt>The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally <elink ref="14">silicon</elink> dioxide sand and other silicates. Common fluxes include limestone (principally calcium carbonate) and dolomite (CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to <elink ref="20">calcium</elink> oxide (quicklime):</ptxt>
			<ptxt>CaCO<sub>3</sub> <img type="arrow"/> CaO + CO<sub>2</sub></ptxt>
			<ptxt>Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a slag.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>CaO + SiO<sub>2</sub> <img type="arrow"/> CaSiO<sub>3</sub></ptxt>
			<ptxt>The slag melts in the heat of the furnace, which <elink ref="14">silicon</elink> dioxide would not have. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the more dense molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called pig iron, while the slag can be used as a material in road construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for agriculture.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% <elink ref="6">carbon</elink> dissolved in it. This is subsequently reduced to steel or commercially pure iron, known as wrought iron, using other furnaces or converters.</ptxt>

			<ptxt>The Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries (CIPEC), defunct since 1992, once tried to play a similar role for copper as OPEC does for oil, but never achieved the same influence, not least because the second-largest producer, the <slink ref="US">United States</slink>, was never a member.

		<method title="Mining and processing">
			<ptxt>There are zinc mines throughout the world, with the largest producers being <slink ref="CN">China</slink>, <slink ref="AU">Australia</slink> and <slink ref="PE">Peru</slink>. In 2005, <slink ref="CN">China</slink> produced almost one-fourth of the global zinc output, reports the British Geological Survey. Mines and refineries in Europe include Umicore in <slink ref="BE">Belgium</slink>, Tara, Galmoy and Lisheen in <slink ref="IE">Ireland</slink>, and Zinkgruvan in <slink ref="SE">Sweden</slink>. Zinc metal is produced using extractive metallurgy. Zinc sulfide (sphalerite) minerals are concentrated using the froth flotation method and then usually roasted using pyrometallurgy to oxidise the zinc sulfide to zinc oxide. The zinc oxide is leached in several stages of increasingly stronger sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). <elink ref="26">Iron</elink> is usually rejected as Jarosite or goethite, removing other impurities at the same time. The final purification uses zinc dust to remove <elink ref="29">copper</elink>, <elink ref="48">cadmium</elink> and <elink ref="27">cobalt</elink>. The metal is then extracted from the solution by electrowinning as cathodic deposits. Zinc <glink ref="cathode">cathodes</glink> can be directly cast or <glink ref="alloy">alloyed</glink> with <elink ref="13">aluminium</elink>.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Electrolyte solutions must be very pure for electrowinning to be at all efficient. Impurities can change the decomposition voltage enough to where the electrolysis cell produces largely <elink ref="1">hydrogen</elink> gas rather than zinc metal.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>There are two common processes for electrowinning the metal, the low current density process, and the Tainton high current density process. The former uses a 10% sulfuric acid solution as the electolyte, with current density of 270-325 amperes per square meter. The latter uses 22-28% sulfuric acid solution as the electrolyte with current density of about 1000 amperes per square meter. The latter gives better purity and has higher production capacity per volume of electrolyte, but has the disadvantage of running hotter and being more corrosive to the vessel in which it is done. In either of the electrolytic processes, each metric ton of zinc production expends about 3900 kWh (14 MJ) of electric power</ptxt>
			<ptxt>There are also several pyrometallurgical processes that reduce zinc oxide using <elink ref="6">carbon</elink>, then distill the metallic zinc from the resulting mix in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide. These include the Belgian-type horizontal-retort process, the New Jersey Zinc continuous vertical-retort process, and the St. Joseph Lead Company's electrothermal process. The Belgian process requires redistillation to remove impurities of <elink ref="82">lead</elink>, <elink ref="48">cadmium</elink>, <elink ref="26">iron</elink>, <elink ref="29">copper</elink>, and <elink ref="33">arsenic</elink>. The New Jersey process employs a fractionating column, which is absent in the Belgian process, that separates the individual impurities, where they can be sold as byproducts. The St. Joseph Lead Company process heats the zinc oxide/coke mixture by passing an electric current through it rather than by coal or gas fire.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Another pyrometallurgical process is flash smelting. Then zinc oxide is obtained, usually producing zinc of lesser quality than the hydrometallurgical process. Zinc oxide treatment has much fewer applications, but high grade deposits have been successful in producing zinc from zinc oxides and zinc carbonates using hydrometallurgy.</ptxt>

		<method title="Occurrence">
			<ptxt>Since technetium is unstable, only minute traces occur naturally in the Earth's crust as a spontaneous fission product of <elink ref="92">uranium</elink>. In 1999 David Curtis (see above) estimated that a kilogram of <elink ref="92">uranium</elink> contains 1 nanogram (1 x 10<sup>-9</sup> g) of technetium. Extraterrestrial technetium was found in some red giant stars (S-, M-, and N-types) that contain an absorption line in their spectrum indicating the presence of this element.</ptxt>
		</method>
		<method title="Artificial production - Byproduct production in fission wastes">
			<ptxt>In contrast with the rare natural occurrence, bulk quantities of technetium-99 are produced each year from spent nuclear fuel rods, which contain various fission products. The fission of a gram of the rare <glink ref="isotope">isotope</glink> <elink ref="92">uranium</elink>-235 in nuclear reactors yields 27 mg of 99Tc, giving technetium a fission yield of 6.1%. Other fissionable <glink ref="isotope">isotopes</glink> also produce similar yields of technetium.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>It is estimated that up to 1994, about 49,000 TBq (78 metric tons) of technetium was produced in nuclear reactors, which is by far the dominant source of terrestrial technetium. However, only a fraction of the production is used commercially. As of 2005, technetium-99 is available to holders of an ORNL permit for US$83/g plus packing charges.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Since the yield of technetium-99 as a product of the nuclear fission of both <elink ref="92">uranium</elink>-235 and <elink ref="94">plutonium</elink>-239 is moderate, it is present in radioactive waste of fission reactors and is produced when a fission bomb is detonated. The amount of artificially produced technetium in the environment exceeds its natural occurrence to a large extent. This is due to release by atmospheric nuclear testing along with the disposal and processing of high-level radioactive waste. Due to its high fission yield and relatively high <glink ref="hl">half-life</glink>, technetium-99 is one of the main components of nuclear waste. Its decay, measured in becquerels per amount of spent fuel, is dominant at about 104 to 106 years after the creation of the nuclear waste.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>An estimated 160 TBq (about 250 kg) of technetium-99 was released into the environment up to 1994 by atmospheric nuclear tests. The amount of technetium-99 from nuclear reactors released into the environment up to 1986 is estimated to be on the order of 1000 TBq (about 1600 kg), primarily by nuclear fuel reprocessing; most of this was discharged into the sea. In recent years, reprocessing methods have improved to reduce emissions, but as of 2005 the primary release of technetium-99 into the environment is by the Sellafield plant, which released an estimated 550 TBq (about 900 kg) from 1995-1999 into the Irish Sea. From 2000 onwards the amount has been limited by regulation to 90 TBq (about 140 kg) per year.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>As a result of nuclear fuel reprocessing, technetium has been discharged into the sea in a number of locations, and some seafood contains tiny but measurable quantities. For example, lobster from west Cumbria contains small amounts of technetium. The anaerobic, spore-forming bacteria in the Clostridium genus are able to reduce Tc(VII) to Tc(IV). Clostridia bacteria play a role in reducing <elink ref="26">iron</elink>, <elink ref="25">manganese</elink> and <elink ref="92">uranium</elink>, thereby affecting these elements' solubility in soil and sediments. Their ability to reduce technetium may determine a large part of Tc's mobility in industrial wastes and other subsurface environments.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>The long half-life of technetium-99 and its ability to form an anionic species makes it (along with 129I) a major concern when considering long-term disposal of high-level radioactive waste. In addition, many of the processes designed to remove fission products from medium-active process streams in reprocessing plants are designed to remove cationic species like <elink ref="55">caesium</elink> (e.g., <sup>137</sup>Cs) and <elink ref="38">strontium</elink> (e.g., <sup>90</sup>Sr). Hence the pertechnetate is able to escape through these treatment processes. Current disposal options favor burial in geologically stable rock. The primary danger with such a course is that the waste is likely to come into contact with water, which could leach radioactive contamination into the environment. The anionic pertechnetate and <elink ref="53">iodide</elink> are less able to absorb onto the surfaces of minerals so they are likely to be more mobile.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>By comparison <elink ref="94">plutonium</elink>, <elink ref="92">uranium</elink>, and <elink ref="55">caesium</elink> are much more able to bind to soil particles. For this reason, the environmental chemistry of technetium is an active area of research. An alternative disposal method, transmutation, has been demonstrated at CERN for technetium-99. This transmutation process is one in which the technetium (<sup>99</sup>Tc as a metal target) is bombarded with neutrons to form the shortlived <sup>100</sup>Tc (<glink ref="hl">half life</glink> = 16 seconds) which decays by beta decay to ruthenium (<sup>100</sup>Ru). One disadvantage of this process is the need for a very pure technetium target, while small traces of other fission products are likely to slightly increase the activity of the irradated target if small traces of the minor actinoids (such as <elink ref="95">americium</elink> and <elink ref="96">curium</elink>) are present in the target then they are likely to undergo fission to form fission products. In this way, a small activity and amount of minor actinoids leads to a very high level of radioactivity in the irradated target. The formation of <sup>106</sup>Ru (<glink ref="hl">half life</glink> 374 days) from the fresh fission is likely to increase the activity of the final <elink ref="44">ruthenium</elink> metal, which will then require a longer cooling time after irradiation before the ruthenium can be used.</ptxt>

			<ptxt>The actual production of technetium-99 from spent nuclear fuel is a long process. During fuel reprocessing, it appears in the waste liquid, which is highly radioactive.

			<ptxt>The meta stable (a state where the <glink ref="nucleus">nucleus</glink> is in an excited state) <glink ref="isotope">isotope</glink> <sup>99m</sup>Tc is produced as a fission product from the fission of <elink ref="92">uranium</elink> or <elink ref="94">plutonium</elink> in nuclear reactors. Due to the fact that used fuel is allowed to stand for several years before reprocessing, all <sup>99</sup>Mo and <sup>99m</sup>Tc will have decayed by the time that the fission products are separated from the major actinoids in conventional nuclear reprocessing. The PUREX raffinate will contain a high concentration of technetium as TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> but almost all of this will be <sup>99</sup>Tc. The vast majority of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc used in medical work is formed from 99Mo which is formed by the neutron activation of <sup>98</sup>Mo. <sup>99</sup>Mo has a <glink ref="hl">half-life</glink> of 67 hours, so short-lived <sup>99m</sup>Tc (half-life: 6 hours), which results from its decay, is being constantly produced. The hospital then chemically extracts the technetium from the solution by using a technetium-99m generator ("technetium cow," also occasionally called a molybdenum cow).</ptxt>
			<ptxt>The normal technetium cow is an alumina column which contains <elink ref="42">molybdenum-98</elink>; inasmuch as <elink ref="13">aluminium</elink> has a small <glink ref="neutron">neutron</glink> cross section, it is convenient for an alumina column bearing inactive <sup>98</sup>Mo to be irradated with neutrons to make the radioactive Mo-99 column for the technetium cow. By working in this way, there is no need for the complex chemical steps which would be required to separate <elink ref="42">molybdenum</elink> from a fission product mixture. This alternative method requires that an enriched <elink ref="92">uranium</elink> target be irradiated with <glink ref="neutron">neutrons</glink> to form <sup>99</sup>Mo as a fission product, then separated.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Other technetium <glink ref="isotope">isotopes</glink> are not produced in significant quantities by fission; when needed, they are manufactured by neutron irradiation of parent <glink ref="isotope">isotopes</glink> (for example, <sup>97</sup>Tc can be made by neutron irradiation of <sup>96</sup>Ru).</ptxt>

			<ptxt>It is also possible to extract rhodium from used nuclear fuel, which contains rhodium (1 kg of the fission products of <sup>235</sup>U contain 13.3 grams of <sup>103</sup>Rh. So as a typical used fuel is 3% fission products by weight it will contain about 400 grams of rhodium per ton of used fuel.

If the fission occurs in an instant then 13.3 grams of rhodium will contain 67.1 MBq (1.81 mCi) of <sup>102</sup>Rh and 10.8 MBq (291 uCi) of <sup>102m</sup>Rh. As it is normal to allow used nuclear fuel to stand for about five years before reprocessing, much of this activity will decay away leaving 4.7 MBq of <sup>102</sup>Rh and 5.0 MBq of <sup>102m</sup>Rh. If the rhodium metal was then left for 20 years after fission then the 13.3 grams of rhodium metal would contain 1.3 kBq of <sup>102</sup>Rh and 500 kBq of <sup>102</sup>mRh. At first glance the rhodium might be adding to the resource value of reprocessed fission waste, but the cost of the separation of the rhodium from the other metals needs to be considered.</ptxt>

			<ptxt>Cadmium-containing ores are rare and when found they occur in small quantities. Greenockite (CdS), the only cadmium mineral of importance, is nearly always associated with sphalerite (ZnS).

Since ore grades of 30g/1000kg (30 ppm) are usually needed before gold is visible to the naked eye, in most gold mines the gold is invisible.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Since the 1880s, <slink ref="ZA">South Africa</slink> has been the source for a large proportion of the world's gold supply. Production in 1970 accounted for 79% of the world supply, producing about 1,000 tonnes. However, production in 2005 was just 294 tonnes according to the British Geological Survey. This sharp decline was due to the increasing difficulty of extraction and changing economic factors affecting the industry in South Africa.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>The city of Johannesburg was built atop the world's greatest gold finds. Gold fields in the Free State and Gauteng provinces are deep and require the world's deepest mines. The Second Boer War of 1899-1901 between the British Empire and the Afrikaner Boers was at least partly over the rights of miners and possession of the gold wealth in <slink ref="ZA">South Africa</slink>.</ptxt>

In South America, the controversial project Pascua Lama aims at exploitation of rich fields in the high mountains of Atacama Desert, at the border between <slink ref="CL">Chile</slink> and <slink ref="AR">Argentina</slink>. Today about one-quarter of the world gold output is estimated to originate from artisanal or small scale mining.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>After initial production, gold is often subsequently refined industrially by the Wohlwill process or the Miller process.

			<ptxt>The world's oceans hold a vast amount of gold, but in very low concentrations (perhaps 1-2 parts per billion). A number of people have claimed to be able to economically recover gold from sea water, but so far they have all been either mistaken or crooks.

			<ptxt>Fritz Haber (the German inventor of the Haber process) attempted commercial extraction of gold from sea water in an effort to help pay <slink ref="DE">Germany's</slink> reparations following the First World War. Unfortunately, his assessment of the concentration of gold in sea water was unduly high, probably due to sample contamination. The effort produced little gold and cost the German government far more than the commercial value of the gold recovered. No commercially viable mechanism for performing gold extraction from sea water has yet been identified. Gold synthesis is not economically viable and is unlikely to become so in the foreseeable future.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>The average gold mining and extraction costs are $238 per troy ounce but these can vary widely depending on mining type and ore quality. In 2001, global mine production amounted to 2,604 tonnes, or 67% of total gold demand in that year. At the end of 2001, it was estimated that all the gold ever mined totalled 145,000 tonnes.</ptxt>

			<ptxt>Native lead does occur in nature, but it is rare. Currently lead is usually found in ore with <elink ref="30">zinc</elink>, <elink ref="47">silver</elink> and (most abundantly) <elink ref="29">copper</elink>, and is extracted together with these metals. The main lead mineral is galena (PbS), which contains 86.6% lead. Other common varieties are cerussite (PbCO<sub>3</sub>) and anglesite (PbSO<sub>4</sub>). The largest current source of lead, however, is recycling, primarily of automobile batteries.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>In mining, the ore is extracted by drilling or blasting and then is crushed and ground. The ore is then treated using extractive metallurgy. The Froth flotation process separates the lead and other minerals from the waste rock (tailings) to form a concentrate. The concentrate, which can range from 50% to 60% lead, is dried and then treated using pyrometallurgy. The concentrate is sintered before being smelted in to produce a 97% lead concentrate. The lead is then cooled in stages which causes the lighter impurites (dross) to rise to the surface where they can be removed. The molten lead bullion is then refined by additional smelting with air being passed over the lead to form a slag layer containing any remaining impurities and producing 99.9% pure lead.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Lead ore (galena) is found commonly in north-east Wales. The North-east Wales Orefield was by far the most important source of lead and <elink ref="30">zinc</elink> in Wales and second in national importance only to the North Pennine Orefield. Lead mining dates back to at least Roman times and continued until well into the 20th century. Galena can be found today in the spoil heaps associated with mining activity. Galena is present in steeply-dipping fissure veins and in pipes and is in Mississippi Valley-type lead-zinc-fluorite and copper-dolomite associations. The mineralisation occurs in the upper parts of the Loggerheads and Cefn Mawr Formations of the Carboniferous Limestone.</ptxt>

			<ptxt>Uranium is a naturally occurring element that can be found in low levels within all rock, soil, and water. Uranium is also the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on earth and is always found combined with other elements. Along with all elements having atomic weights higher than that of <elink ref="26">iron</elink>, it is only naturally formed in supernova explosions. The decay of uranium, <elink ref="90">thorium</elink> and <elink ref="19">potassium</elink>-40 in the Earth's mantle is thought to be the main source of heat that keeps the outer core liquid and drives mantle convection, which in turn drives plate tectonics.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Its average concentration in the Earth's crust is (depending on the reference) 2 to 4 parts per million, or about 40 times as abundant as <elink ref="47">silver</elink>. The Earth's crust from the surface to 25 km (15 mi) down is calculated to contain 10<sup>17</sup> kg of uranium while the oceans may contain 10<sup>13</sup> kg. The concentration of uranium in soil ranges from 0.7 to 11 parts per million (up to 15 parts per million in farmland soil due to use of phosphate fertilizers), and 3 parts per billion of sea water is composed of the element.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>It is more plentiful than <elink ref="51">antimony</elink>, <elink ref="50">tin</elink>, <elink ref="48">cadmium</elink>, <elink ref="80">mercury</elink>, or <elink ref="47">silver</elink>, and it is about as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum. It is found in hundreds of minerals including uraninite (the most common uranium ore), autunite, uranophane, torbernite, and coffinite. Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits, and minerals such as lignite, and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores (it is recovered commercially from these sources with as little as 0.1% uranium).</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Citrobacter species can have concentrations of uranium in their bodies 300 times higher than in the surrounding environment.Some microorganisms, such as the lichen Trapelia involuta or the bacterium Citrobacter, can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times higher than their environment. Citrobactor species absorb uranyl <glink ref="ion">ions</glink> when given glycerol phosphate (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of bacteria will encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used to decontaminate uranium-polluted water.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Plants absorb some uranium from the soil they are rooted in. Dry weight concentrations of uranium in plants range from 5 to 60 parts per billion, and ash from burnt wood can have concentrations up to 4 parts per million. Dry weight concentrations of uranium in food plants are typically lower with one to two micrograms per day ingested through the food people eat.</ptxt>
		</method>
		<method title="Production and Mining">
			<ptxt>Uranium ore is mined in several ways: by open pit, underground, or by in-situ leaching (see uranium mining). Low-grade uranium ore typically contains 0.1 to 0.25% of actual uranium oxides, so extensive measures must be employed to extract the metal from its ore. High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan, <slink ref="CA">Canada</slink> can contain up to 70% uranium oxides, and therefore must be diluted with waste rock prior to milling. Uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an <glink ref="acid">acid</glink> or alkali. The leachate is then subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation, solvent extraction, and ion exchange. The resulting mixture, called yellowcake, contains at least 75% uranium oxides. Yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process prior to refining and conversion.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Commercial-grade uranium can be produced through the reduction of uranium halides with alkali or alkaline earth metals. Uranium metal can also be made through electrolysis of KUF<sub>5</sub> or UF<sub>4</sub>, dissolved in a molten <elink ref="20">calcium</elink> <elink ref="17">chloride</elink> (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) and <elink ref="11">sodium</elink> <elink ref="17">chloride</elink> (NaCl) solution. Very pure uranium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of uranium halides on a hot filament.</ptxt>
		</method>
		<method title="Availability">
			<ptxt>It is estimated that there is 4.7 million tonnes of uranium ore reserves (economically mineable) known to exist, while 35 million tonnes are classed as mineral resources (reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction). An additional 4.6 billion tonnes of uranium are estimated to be in sea water (Japanese scientists in the 1980s proved that extraction of uranium from sea water using ion exchangers was feasible).</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Exploration for uranium is continuing to increase with US$200 million being spent world wide in 2005, a 54% increase on the previous year.</ptxt>
			<ptxt><slink ref="AU">Australia</slink> has 38% of the world's uranium ore resources - the most of any country. In fact, the world's largest single uranium deposit is located at the Olympic Dam Mine in South <slink ref="AU">Australia</slink>. Almost all the uranium is exported, under strict International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards to satisfy the Australian people and government that none of the uranium is used in nuclear weapons. As of 2006, the Australian government was advocating an expansion of uranium mining, although issues with state governments and indigenous interests complicate the issue.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>The largest single source of uranium ore in the <slink ref="US">United States</slink> was the Colorado Plateau located in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona. The U.S. federal government paid discovery bonuses and guaranteed purchase prices to anyone who found and delivered uranium ore, and was the sole legal purchaser of the uranium. The economic incentives resulted in a frenzy of exploration and mining activity throughout the Colorado Plateau from 1947 through 1959 that left thousands of miles of crudely graded roads spider-webbing the remote deserts of the Colorado Plateau, and thousands of abandoned uranium mines, exploratory shafts, and tailings piles. The frenzy ended as suddenly as it had begun, when the U.S. government stopped purchasing the uranium.</ptxt>						
			<ptxt>In 2005, seventeen countries produced concentrated uranium oxides, with <slink ref="CA">Canada</slink> (27.9% of world production) and <slink ref="AU">Australia</slink> (22.8%) being the largest producers and <slink ref="KZ">Kazakhstan</slink> (10.5%), <slink ref="RU">Russia</slink> (8.0%), <slink ref="NA">Namibia</slink> (7.5%), <slink ref="NE">Niger</slink> (7.4%), <slink ref="UZ">Uzbekistan</slink> (5.5%), the <slink ref="US">United States</slink> (2.5%), <slink ref="UA">Ukraine</slink> (1.9%) and <slink ref="CN">China</slink> (1.7%) also producing significant amounts. The ultimate supply of uranium is believed to very large and sufficient for at least the next 85 years although some studies indicate underinvestment in the late twentieth century may produce supply problems in the 21st century. It is estimated that for a ten times increase in price, the supply of uranium that can be economically mined is increased 300 times.</ptxt>

The other fissile materials are <elink ref="92">uranium</elink>-235 and <elink ref="92">uranium</elink>-233. Plutonium-239 is virtually nonexistent in nature. It is made by bombarding <elink ref="92">uranium</elink>-238 with <glink ref="neutron">neutrons</glink> in a nuclear reactor. Uranium-238 is present in quantity in most reactor fuel; hence plutonium-239 is continuously made in these reactors. Since plutonium-239 can itself be split by neutrons to release energy, plutonium-239 provides a portion of the energy generation in a nuclear reactor.</ptxt>
		</method>
		<method title="Manufacture of Pu-238">
			<ptxt>There are small amounts of Pu-238 in the plutonium of usual plutonium-producing reactors. However, isotopic separation would be quite expensive compared to another method: when a U-235 <glink ref="atom">atom</glink> captures a <glink ref="neutron">neutron</glink>, it is converted to an excited state of U-236. Some of the excited U-236 <glink ref="nucleus">nuclei</glink> undergo fission, but some decay to the ground state of U-236 by emitting <glink ref="gr">gamma radiation</glink>. Further neutron capture creates U-237 which has a <glink ref="hl">half-life</glink> of 7 days and thus quickly decays to Np-237. Since nearly all <elink ref="93">neptunium</elink> is produced in this way or consists of <glink ref="isotope">isotopes</glink> which decay quickly, one gets nearly pure Np-237 by chemical separation of neptunium. After this chemical separation, Np-237 is again irradiated by reactor neutrons to be converted to Np-238 which decays to Pu-238 with a <glink ref="hl">half-life</glink> of 2 days.</ptxt>
