<uses>None.</uses>
<notes>
<ptext>As only a few atoms of element 112 have ever been made (through a nuclear reaction involving fusing a <elink ref="30">zinc</elink> atom with a <elink ref="82">lead</elink> atom) isolation of an observable quantity has never been achieved, and may well never be. This is because atoms of the element decompose through the emission of <glink ref="ad">a-particles</glink> with a <glink ref="hl">half life</glink> of only about 240 microseconds.</ptext>

<ptext>Experiments resulting in the formation of element 115 were reported in February 2004 following experiments carried out between 14 July - 10 August 2003 involving scientists at Dubna (Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at the U400 cyclotron with the Dubna gas-filled recoil separator, DGFRS) in Russia in a collaboration also involving scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA. Only four nuclei were identified and the claim has not yet been ratified, but the results are now published in a reputable peer-reviewed journal.</ptext>
<ptext>Currently, the identification of element 115 is yet to be confirmed by IUPAC, but the experiments leading to element 115 are now published in a prestigious peer reviewed journal. As only about four atoms of element 115 have ever been made (through nuclear reactions involving fusing <elink ref="20">calcium</elink> nuclei with <elink ref="95">americium</elink> <glink ref="nucleus">nuclei</glink>) isolation of an observable quantity has never been achieved, and may well never be.</ptext>

<sources>Experiments resulting in the formation of element 113 were reported in February 2004 following experiments carried out between 14 July - 10 August 2003 involving scientists at Dubna (Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at the U400 cyclotron with the Dubna gas-filled recoil separator, DGFRS) in Russia in a collaboration also involving scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA. In these experiments, the primary product were four nuclei of element 115 isotopes. All these four nuclei decayed through the emisson of a-particles to isotopes of element 113. The claim has not yet been ratified, but the results are now published in a reputable peer-reviewed journal.</sources>
