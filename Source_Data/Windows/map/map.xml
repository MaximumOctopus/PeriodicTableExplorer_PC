		<section title="Helium" an="2">
			<ptxt>After an oil drilling operation in 1903 in Dexter, Kansas produced a gas geyser that would not burn, Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth collected samples of the escaping gas and took them back to the University of Kansas at Lawrence where it was discovered that 1.84% of the gas sample was helium. This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction from natural gas.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>The United States Navy sponsored three small experimental helium production plants during World War I, the goal being to supply barrage balloons. A total of 5,700 m<sup>3</sup> of 92%-pure helium was produced in the program even though less than 100 litres of the gas had previously been obtained.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>In 1925 the government of the United States set up the National Helium Reserve at Amarillo, Texas with the goal of supplying military airships in time of war and commercial airships in peacetime. Due to a US military embargo against <slink ref="de">Germany</slink> that restricted helium supplies, the Hindenburg was forced to use <elink ref="1">hydrogen</elink> as the lift gas. Helium use following World War II was depressed but the reserve was expanded in the 1950s to ensure a supply of liquid helium as a coolant to create <elink ref="8">oxygen</elink>/<elink ref="1">hydrogen</elink> rocket fuel (among other uses) during the Space Race and Cold War. Helium use in the United States in 1965 was more than eight times the peak wartime consumption.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>For many years the United States produced over 90% of commercially usable helium in the world, while extraction plants in <slink ref="ca">Canada</slink>, <slink ref="pl">Poland</slink>, <slink ref="ru">Russia</slink>, and other nations produced the remainder. In the mid-1990s, a new plant in Arzew, Algeria producing 1.7 x 10<sup>7</sup> m<sup>3</sup> began operation, with enough production to cover all of Europe's demand. In 2004-2006, two additional plants, one in Ras Laffen, <slink ref="qa">Qatar</slink> and the other in Skikda, <slink ref="dz">Algeria</slink> were built, but as of early 2007, Ras Laffen is functioning at 50%, and Skikda has yet to start up. Algeria quickly became the second leading producer of helium.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Figures for 2002 show the USA produced 86% of the world's helium, <slink ref="dz">Algeria</slink> 9% and <slink ref="ru">Russia</slink>/<slink ref="pl">Poland</slink> 5%.</ptxt>

Carbon is abundant in the Sun, stars, comets, and in the atmospheres of most planets. Some meteorites contain microscopic diamonds that were formed when the solar system was still a protoplanetary disk. Microscopic diamonds may also be formed by the intense pressure and high temperature at the sites of meteorite impacts.</ptxt>

		<section title="Nitrogen" an="7">
			<ptxt>Molecular nitrogen and nitrogen compounds have been detected in interstellar space by astronomers using the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer. Molecular nitrogen is a major constituent of the Saturnian moon Titan's thick atmosphere, and occurs in trace amounts in other planetary atmospheres.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Oxygen" an="8">
			<ptxt>Oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen and helium.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>About 0.9% of the Sun's mass is oxygen. Mars' atmosphere has an oxygen concentration of 0.1% O<sub>2</sub> by volume, Earth's, by contrast, is 21%.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Neon" an="10">
			<ptxt>Neon is actually abundant on a universal scale; it's the fifth most abundant chemical element in the universe by mass, after hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and carbon.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Mass abundance in the universe is about 1 part in 750 and in the Sun and presumably in the proto-solar system nebula, about 1 part in 600.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>The Galileo spacecraft atmospheric entry probe found that in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter, neon is found in a ratio of 1 part in 6000, by mass.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Sodium" an="11">
			<ptxt>Sodium is relatively abundant in stars and the D spectral lines of this element are among the most prominent in star light. Though elemental sodium has a rather high vaporization temperature, its relatively high abundance and very intense spectral lines have allowed its presence to be detected by ground telescopes and confirmed by spacecraft (Mariner 10 and MESSENGER) in the thin atmosphere of the planet Mercury.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Magnesium" an="12">
			<ptxt>Magnesium is the ninth most abundant element in the universe by mass.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Aluminium" an="13">
			<ptxt>Meteorite research has also shown that <sup>26</sup>Al was relatively abundant at the time of formation of our planetary system. Most meteoriticists believe that the energy released by the decay of 26Al was responsible for the melting and differentiation of some asteroids after their formation 4.55 billion years ago.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Silicon" an="14">
			<ptxt>Silicon is a principal component of aerolites, which are a class of meteoroids, a small sand- to boulder-sized particle of debris in the Solar System.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Sulphur" an="16">
			<ptxt>The distinctive colours of Jupiter's volcanic moon, Io, are from various forms of molten, solid and gaseous sulfur. There is also a dark area near the Lunar crater Aristarchus that may be a sulfur deposit.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Sulfur is present in many types of meteorites. Ordinary chondrites contain on average 2.1% sulfur, and carbonaceous chondrites may contain as much as 6.6%. Sulfur in meteorites is normally present entirely as troilite (FeS), but other sulfides are found in some meteorites, and carbonaceous chondrites contain free sulfur, sulfates, and possibly other sulfur compounds.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Argon" an="18">
			<ptxt>The Martian atmosphere in contrast contains 1.6% of argon-40 and 5 ppm of argon-36. The Mariner spaceprobe fly-by of the planet Mercury in 1973 found that Mercury has a very thin atmosphere with 70% argon, believed to result from releases of the gas as a decay product from radioactive materials on the planet. In 2005, the Huygens probe also discovered the presence of argon-40 on Titan, the largest moon of Saturn.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Calcium" an="20">
			<ptxt>In the visible portion of the spectrum of many stars, including the Sun, strong absorption lines of singly-ionized calcium are shown. Prominent among these are the H-line at 3968.5 &Aring; and the K line at 3933.7 &Aring; of singly-ionized calcium, or Ca II. For the Sun and stars with low temperatures, the prominence of the H and K lines can be an indication of strong magnetic activity in the chromosphere. Measurement of periodic variations of these active regions can also be used to deduce the rotation periods of these stars.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Titanium" an="22">
			<ptxt>Titanium is contained in meteorites and has been detected in the sun and in M-type stars; the coolest type of star with a surface temperature of 3,200&degree;C (5,792&degree;F). Rocks brought back from the moon during the Apollo 17 mission are composed of 12.1% TiO<sub>2</sub>.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Iron" an="26">
			<ptxt>Iron is the heaviest element produced by stellar nucleosynthesis; heavier elements require a red giant or supernova for their formation. Iron and nickel are the most abundant metals in iron meteorites and in the dense metal cores of planets such as Earth. Although rare, meteorites are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>In phases of the meteorites Semarkona and Chervony Kut a correlation between the concentration of <sup>60</sup>Ni, the daughter product of <sup>60</sup>Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of <sup>60</sup>Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of <sup>60</sup>Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide <sup>26</sup>Al, to the remelting and differentiation of asteroids after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of <sup>60</sup>Ni present in extraterrestrial material may also provide further insight into the origin of the solar system and its early history.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Nickel" an="28">
			<ptxt>Nickel-78's half-life was recently measured to be 110 milliseconds and is believed to be an important isotope involved in supernova nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than iron.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Yttrium" an="39">
			<ptxt>Yttrium in the Solar System was created through stellar nucleosynthesis, mostly by the s-process (about 72%), but also by the r-process (about 28%). The r-process consists of rapid neutron capture of lighter elements during supernova explosions. The s-process is a slow neutron capture of lighter elements inside pulsating red giant stars.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Zirconium" an="40">
			<ptxt>Zirconium is relatively-abundant in S-type stars, and it has been detected in the sun and in meteorites. Lunar rock samples brought back from several Apollo program missions to the moon have a quite high zirconium oxide content relative to terrestrial rocks.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Technetium" an="43">
			<ptxt>No isotope of technetium has a half-life longer than 4.2 million years (<sup>98</sup>Tc), so its detection in red giants in 1952 helped bolster the theory that stars can produce heavier elements.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Xenon" an="54">
			<ptxt>Xenon is relatively rare in the Sun's atmosphere, on Earth, and in asteroids and comets. The atmosphere of Mars shows a xenon abundance similar to that of Earth: 0.08 parts per million, however Mars shows a higher proportion of <sup>129</sup>Xe than the Earth or the Sun.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>The planet Jupiter has an unusually high abundance of xenon in its atmosphere; about 2.6 times as much as the Sun.</ptxt>
			<ptxt>Unlike the lower mass noble gases, the normal stellar nucleosynthesis process inside a star does not form xenon. Elements more massive than iron-56 have a net energy cost to produce through fusion, so there is no energy gain for a star to create xenon. Instead, many isotopes of xenon are formed during supernova explosions.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Promethium" an="61">
			<ptxt>Promethium has also been identified in the spectrum of the star HR 465 in Andromeda, and possibly HD 101065 (Przybylski's star) and HD 965.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Europium" an="63">
			<ptxt>Europium has been identified in the spectra of the sun and certain stars.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Iridium" an="77">
			<ptxt>Iridium is relatively common in meteorites, with concentrations of 0.5 ppm or more. The Willamette meteorite, the largest meteorite found in the <slink ref="us">U.S.</slink>, has 4.7 ppm of iridium.</ptxt>
		</section>
		<section title="Platinum" an="78">
			<ptxt>Platinum exists in relatively higher abundances on the Moon and in meteorites. Correspondingly, platinum is found in slightly higher abundances at sites of bolide impact on the Earth that are associated with resulting post-impact volcanism, and can be mined economically; the Sudbury Basin is one such example.</ptxt>
